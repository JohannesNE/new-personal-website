    "text": "Heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) have some interesting properties. When they are activated, they depolarize. Depolarization causes the cell to contract, but also activates neighboring cells.\nThe following is a grid of simulated cardiomyocytes. They are all in a resting state, ready to be activated.\nActivated cells are black. After a short moment, they become inactive and refractory. Refractory cells cannot be activated. In the simulation, refractory cells go from dark gray to light gray, until they have regained their resting state, and are ready for a new activation.\nNotice, that the activation is not entirely symmetric and predictable. The give the simulation a more organic feel, I added a bit of randomness to the activation of cells. Each cell is activated with a higher probability the more of its four neighbors are active (33% chance if one neighbor is active. 100% change of 3 or 4 neighbors are active)."

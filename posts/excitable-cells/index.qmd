Heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) have some interesting properties. When they are activated, they [depolarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization). Depolarization causes the cell to contract, but also activates neighboring cells.

The following is a grid of simulated cardiomyocytes. They are all in a *resting state*, ready to be *activated*.

Activated cells are black. After a short moment, they become inactive and *refractory*. Refractory cells cannot be activated. In the simulation, refractory cells go from dark gray to light gray, until they have regained their resting state, and are ready for a new activation.

Notice, that the activation is not entirely symmetric and predictable. The give the simulation a more organic feel, I added a bit of randomness to the activation of cells. Each cell is activated with a higher probability the more of its four neighbors are active (33% chance if one neighbor is active. 100% change of 3 or 4 neighbors are active).

## Pacemaker cells

Another interesting property of cardiomyocytes are their *automaticity*. Cardiomyocytes spontaneously activate if they are not stimulated by a neighboring cells for a period. Cells in the *sinoatrial node* (sinus node) in the right atrium have the fastest rate of spontaneous activation, and thus activate the remaining heart. The sinus node is the heart's pacemaker.

In the following simulation, a cluster of cells in the top, left corner act as pacemaker cells.

When the spontaneous depolarization of the sinus node determines the heart rate, the heart is said to be in [sinus rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_rhythm). If the sinus node paces the heart at a rate faster than 100 beats per minute, the rhythm is called [sinus tachycardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_tachycardia). Sinus tachycardia (together with increased stroke volume) increases the flow of blood from the heart, and is the normal (physiological) response to exercise. 

## Reentry tachycardia

In reentry tachycardia, the heart is not paced by the sinus not, but instead from a group of cells that have formed a circuit, where a wave of depolarization can loop around, and stimulate itself over and over. This requires an non-responsive area among the cells (an area that cannot be activated), so a circuit can form around it.

In the simulation below, the red cells are non-responsive (dead). They could represent scar tissue after a [mycardial infarction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction)---[a common cause of ventricular tachycardia](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2744510/). Or the simulation could illustrate [atrial flutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_flutter), where a reentrant loop can form around the tricuspid valve.

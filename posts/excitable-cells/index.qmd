Heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) have some interesting properties. When they are activated, they [depolarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization). Depolarization causes the cell to contract, but also activates neighboring cells.

The following is a grid of simulated cardiomyocytes. They are all in a *resting state*, ready to be *activated*.

Activated cells are black. After a short moment, they become inactive and *refractory*. Refractory cells cannot be activated. In the simulation, refractory cells go from dark gray to light gray, until they have regained their resting state, and are ready for a new activation.

Notice, that the activation is not entirely symmetric and predictable. The give the simulation a more organic feel, I added a bit of randomness to the activation of cells. Each cell is activated with a higher probability the more of its four neighbors are active (33% chance if one neighbor is active. 100% change of 3 or 4 neighbors are active).

## Pacemaker cells

Another interesting property of cardiomyocytes are their ability to
